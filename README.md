# Carter Discord Bot Example

## Getting Started

Download the bot code from a repository to your computer.
You can do this by "cloning" the repository (a copy of the code) to your local machine, or by downloading a ZIP file of the code.

Install the required Python packages by running a command in your terminal.
To run the bot, you need to have certain Python packages installed. You can install them all at once by running the command "pip install -r requirements.txt" in your terminal.

Create a new application and bot on the Discord Developer Portal and copy the bot token.
Discord is a chat platform where your bot will live. To create a bot, you first need to create an application on the Discord Developer Portal. Then, create a bot for your application and copy its token. This token is like a password that allows your bot to access Discord.

Create a new project on the CarterLabs dashboard and name your character. Follow the prompts on the dashboard and then create a new API key and copy it.
CarterLabs is a service that helps you create and manage your bot. You need to create a new project on the CarterLabs dashboard and name your character. Then, follow the prompts on the dashboard to create a new API key, which is another password that allows your bot to use CarterLabs.

Open the config.py file and fill in the necessary details, including the API keys.
The config.py file contains settings for your bot, such as its name and the passwords for Discord and CarterLabs. Open this file and fill in the necessary details, including the API keys you copied in steps 3 and 4.

Run the bot by typing "python Bot.py" in your terminal.
Once you've completed all the above steps, you can start running the bot by typing "python Bot.py" in your terminal. This will start the bot and it will begin listening for commands on Discord.
